translate  them to dart files please. each js file correpsonding to one dart file. If type definitions are needed or suggested, they should be added to static_typedefs.dart.



## migrate test file
I'm working on translating a JavaScript library to Dart, doing a one-to-one file conversion. I need help converting  into its Dart equivalent. And you could also change the file it depends on to make it work.

Requirements:
1. The Dart version must match the functionality of the original JavaScript.
2. Do not create any new Dart files unless there is a corresponding file in the original JS library.
3. If type definitions are needed or suggested, they should be added to static_typedefs.dart.

Please help me: to make dart test test/test_clone.dart pass
