// In Dart, symbols are not typically used in the same way as JavaScript Symbols
// for opaque properties or to facilitate tree-shaking in the manner described.
// Dart's type system and privacy (library-private members with `_`) handle encapsulation.
// Tree-shaking (dead code elimination) is a standard feature of Dart compilers (dart2js, AOT compilation).

// If the intent is to have a unique identifier for walkers or a way to mark them,
// a const String or an enum could be used, or simply relying on class types.

// For now, I will provide a const String as a Dart equivalent of a named Symbol.
// If this symbol is used for more complex JavaScript metaprogramming equivalent,
// the Dart approach would likely differ significantly.

const String gitWalkSymbol = 'GitWalkSymbol';

// Example of how it might be used if it were for type checking or identification,
// though this is not a direct equivalent of JS Symbol behavior in all contexts.
// class GitWalker {
//   final String _type = gitWalkSymbol;
//   bool get isGitWalker => _type == gitWalkSymbol;
// }
